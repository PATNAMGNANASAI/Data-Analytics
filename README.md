# Data-Analytics

Steps to Build the Dashboard:
1. Data Collection & Understanding:
Objective: Gather all relevant employee data, such as demographic information, salary details, years of experience, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.
Actions:
Import data from HR databases (e.g., Excel sheets, CSV files, or direct database connections).
Ensure the dataset includes essential columns like Employee ID, Age, Salary, Department, Education Field, Job Role, Attrition, Years at Company, and Gender.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Objective: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Actions:
Handle missing values: Either remove records with null values (if minimal) or use imputation techniques like filling nulls with average/median values for numeric fields.
Data consistency: Standardize categories such as department names, job roles, and gender.
Outliers: Identify outliers in salary or age that may distort the analysis and decide whether to include or exclude them based on context.
Remove Duplicates: Ensure that there are no duplicate employee records.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Objective: Conduct an initial analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
Actions:
Attrition rate: Calculate the overall attrition rate ((Number of Attritions / Total Employees) * 100).
Salary Distribution: Create a histogram of employee salaries to check for trends.
Attrition by Age, Gender, and Department: Segment attrition data based on demographic features.
Satisfaction Scores: Check if satisfaction scores vary by job role and their correlation with attrition.
4. Data Modeling:
Objective: Define relationships between various tables in the dataset, especially if working with multiple data sources (employee data, salary records, satisfaction surveys).
Actions:
Establish relationships between employee demographic data, salary data, and attrition data.
Ensure thereâ€™s a one-to-many relationship between employees and their departments, job roles, and satisfaction scores.
5. Dashboard Design & Development in Power BI:
Objective: Visualize key metrics and trends for HR analysis.
Actions:
KPI Visualizations: Include cards displaying key statistics like:
Total employees (882)
Attrition rate (17%)
Average salary (6.4K)
Average age (37)
Average years at the company (6.9 years)
Attrition Breakdown: Use bar/column charts to show attrition by job role, age, education field, gender, and salary.
Interactive Slicers: Implement slicers to filter data based on department, job role, or satisfaction scores.
Attrition by Salary Ranges: A bar chart comparing attrition rates across salary brackets (<5k, 5k-10k, 10k-15k, and 15k+).
Attrition by Job Role: Bar chart showing the count of attrition for each job role, highlighting high-attrition roles like Laboratory Technician (46 attritions) and Sales Executive (37 attritions).
6. Insights Generation:
Objective: Identify trends and insights that can help the HR team make decisions.
Actions:
High Attrition in Specific Roles: E.g., laboratory technicians and sales executives show high attrition rates, indicating a need for deeper investigation.
Salary Impact on Attrition: Attrition is more frequent in lower salary brackets (<5k and 5k-10k), suggesting that compensation may be a contributing factor.
Age and Experience Trends: Employees with 0-5 years at the company or aged 26-35 show higher attrition, which could suggest dissatisfaction among newer or mid-career employees.
7. Dashboard Testing and Feedback:
Objective: Ensure that the dashboard is user-friendly and provides the necessary insights.
Actions:
Test the dashboard with key stakeholders (HR managers, department heads) to ensure it meets their requirements.
Gather feedback on the clarity of visuals and adjust as necessary, adding additional insights or visualizations if needed.
Key Metrics to Highlight:
Attrition Rate: A 17% attrition rate.
Job Role Analysis: Sales and laboratory roles have the highest attrition.
Salary Insights: Attrition is most common in the 5k-10k salary range.
Age and Experience: Employees aged 26-35 and those with fewer years at the company tend to leave more often.
Project Scope Discussion:
Value to the Organization: The dashboard allows the HR team to take targeted actions in addressing employee turnover by focusing on roles or salary brackets with the highest attrition.
Potential Further Development: Predictive modeling could be applied to forecast attrition based on satisfaction scores, salary trends, and demographic data.
In an interview, you can walk through these steps and discuss how each stage of development adds value, ensuring you're prepared to explain both the technical and strategic elements of the project.
